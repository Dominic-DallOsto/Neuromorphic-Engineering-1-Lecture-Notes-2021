\subsection{Know your constants - Tobi will ask you}

Tobi \textbf{will} ask you to give constants. Yes I know, why would you bother remembering this in the age of internet? Well, general knowledge and showing off in dinner conversation is one reason. Truth is, it's important because it gives you an idea of the scale of things. Knowing the units is also very important, arguably more important than the numbers - helps you properly understand the purpose of the given constant.

Here are the constants you should know: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item $Kappa$
    \item Charge of an Electron: $e = -1.6 \cdot 10^-19 Coulomb$
    \item Boltzmann Constant: k =$1.38 \cdot 10^{-23} J/K$
    \item Thermal voltage: $U_T$ = $\frac{kT}{q} = 25mV$ at room temperature (T $approx$ 300 Kelvin)
    \item Bandgap of Silicon: 1.12 eV
    \item Planck's Constant $h = 6.64 \cdot 10^{-34} J.s$
    \item Speed of light in vacuum: $c = 3 \cdot 10^8 m.s^{-1}$
    \item Highest photon wavelength that can generate an electron-hole pair in Silicon $\lambda_{max} = 1.1 \mu m$
    \item 1 Lux $\approx 10^4 \mathrm{photons/\mu m^2/s}$
    \item Illumination at moonlight: 0.1 lux. Illumination with full sun: 100.000 lux 
\end{itemize}
