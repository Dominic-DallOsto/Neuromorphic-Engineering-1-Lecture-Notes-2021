\section*{Disclaimer}
These lecture notes were written to help the authors consolidate in a "stupid-proof" manner the content of the fascinating but very challenging Neuromorphic Engineering 1 (NE1) course. They are also meant to help other students of the current or following years to digest the content of the NE1 lectures, to prepare for the exam and, hopefully,  better appreciate the subtleties of the field. They are almost exclusively based on the content taught during Fall 2021 by Prof. Shi-Chii Liu, Prof. Tobi Delbruck & Prof. Giacomo Indiveri at ETHZ. \textbf{We do not claim originality nor completeness}. The containing information is thus freely gathered and often copied word-by-word from the lecture materials or the "Analog VLSI" textbook\footnote{We generally refer to this as the "Textbook": https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/analog-vlsi)} written by the previously mentioned professors (and others). It also reproduces content from other sources such as books, blogs, papers, videos and Wikipedia.
