\section*{Organisation}
The content is organised similarly to the Fall 2021 course schedule: 13 different chapters covering various topics on the topic of Neuromorphic Engineering. The chapters are best
read in order, as much of the content from a given chapter builds on the content from previous chapters. 
Each chapter contains the following: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Stupid-proof facts to understand what is being covered in the chapter + Brief summary of previous topics to master to properly understand the chapter content.
  \item Answers to all questions on the "Study Winter Sheet", which is what should be known for the oral exam.
  \item Lab Summary and takeaways.
\end{itemize}
Additionally, we add the following extra chapters for reference: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Chapter 0: Stupid-Proof explanations of fundamental Electrical Engineering / Physics / Neuroscience for the uninitiated. Warning: This chapter may contain gross approximations and inaccuracies. Consume at your own risk. We'll add references to as many things as possible so we avoid taking the blame :)
    \item Important constants (It is being said that Tobi likes to ask about these in the exam!) 
    \item Advice for exam preparation
\end{itemize}
