\section{Understanding the Transistor}
Warning: This chapter contains gross approximations and simplifications. Do not base yourself on the explanations here for more formal exercises. As the main purpose of NE1 is to understand how to emulate brain function through elaborate transistor circuits, it is only necessary to grasp the intuition behind their intrinsic physical behaviour, and not the details of the physics, which would need a whole semester (at least) to cover properly. This is why we only focus on \textit{grossly} explaining the concepts in a digestible manner, with only the details that will be absolutely necessary to understand later concepts.

% This video presents an amazing water analogy to the idea of the transistor. Definitely something to use!
