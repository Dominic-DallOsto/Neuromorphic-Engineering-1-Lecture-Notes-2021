### Disclaimer
These lecture notes were written to help the authors consolidate in a "stupid-proof" manner the content of the fascinating but very challenging Neuromorphic 1 course. These lecture notes are also meant to help any other student from the current or following years to digest the content of the NE1 lectures, to prepare for the exam and, hopefully,  better appreciate the subtelties of the field. They are almost exclusively based on the content taught during Fall 2021 by Prof. Shi-Chii Liu, Prof. Tobi Delbruck & Prof. Giacomo Indiveri at ETHZ, and do not claim originality nor
completeness. The containing information is thus freely gathered and often copied word-by-word from the lecture materials or the "Analog VLSI" textbook written by the professors
mentionned previous (and other). It also reproduces content from other sources such as books, blogs, papers, videos and Wikipedia. 

### Organisation of the content
The content is organised similarly to the Fall 2021 course schedule: 13 different chapters covering various topics on the topic of Neuromorphic Engineering. The chapters are best
read in order, as much of the content from a given chapter builds on the content from previous chapters. 
Each chapter contains the following: 
* Stupid-proof facts to understand what is being covered in the chapter + Brief summary of previous topics to master to properly understand the chapter.
* Answers to all questions on the "Study Winter Sheet", which is what should be known for the oral exam
* Lab Summary and takeaways.

Additionally, we add the following extra chapters for reference: 
* Chapter 0: Stupid-Proof explanations of fundamental Electrical Engineering / Neuroscience for the uninitiated. Warning: This chapter may contain gross approximations and inaccuracies. Consume at your own risk. We'll add references to as many things as possible so we avoid taking the blame  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ .
* Useful constants (It is being said that Tobi likes to ask about these in the exam!)  
* Advice for exam preparation
